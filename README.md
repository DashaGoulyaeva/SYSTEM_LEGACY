# SYSTEM_LEGACY

> A quiet incremental about memory, servers, and what remains when everything else is gone.

You are the new caretaker. Your task is simple: keep the ancient server cluster **HYPERION-7** operational. Click. Scan. Fix. Reboot.

In time, the routine cracks. Fragments of someone else's memories appear in the system logs, process names take on personal meanings, and the system's stability begins to depend on something more than just code.

This game is a meditative experience, not a race. There are no timers, leaderboards, or pressure. Just you, a terminal, and the quiet hum of a machine that seems to be trying to remember something.

## What's Inside?
*   **Minimalist Interface:** Green text on black. Nothing extra.
*   **Deep Cycles:** Each reboot (defragmentation) reveals a new layer of understanding of the system and its past.
*   **A Story That Unfolds, Not Tells:** The narrative is hidden in logic anomalies, file names, and your actions.
*   **Complete Peace:** Play at your own pace. The world can wait.

## How to Start?
For now, project exists only locally and not ready to accept players.

### 🛠️ For Developers & The Curious
**SYSTEM_LEGACY** is primarily a **learning project** and a creative experiment by a solo developer.

> **Important Note:** The game is in active development. Its concept, mechanics, and direction may change radically as the author learns and experiments. What you see today may become something completely different tomorrow.

*   **Tech Stack:** Vanilla JS, HTML, CSS. No frameworks.
*   **Philosophy:** Maximum simplicity, atmosphere, narrative through gameplay.
*   **Status:** In development. The most valuable resource here is not the system's memory, but the author's time and ideas.
*   **Devlog:** You can peek into the [DEVLOG](./DEVLOG.md) to see how the project is born and evolves.

If this aesthetic resonates with you — welcome. Take a seat. Listen to the hum of the systems. You might hear something familiar in it.
